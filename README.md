# Image Colorization and Outpainting

This project focuses on image colorization and outpainting using various GAN-based models like Pix2Pix, DeepLab, PatchGAN with U-Net, and Encoder-Decoder networks. It offers functionalities for colorizing grayscale images and expanding image boundaries seamlessly.

## Features

- **Image Colorization:** Convert grayscale images into realistic color versions using different models like Pix2Pix, DeepLab, and PatchGAN with U-Net.
- **Outpainting:** Expand image boundaries using an Encoder-Decoder network, allowing for seamless content generation beyond the input image.
- **Blending and Sharpening:** Apply blending techniques for smooth transitions and sharpen outpainted regions for a more refined look.

## Getting Started

Follow the steps below to set up and run the project locally.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
